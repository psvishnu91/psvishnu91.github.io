The dataset chosen for this particular task were the reviews obtained from the yelp website.

Correlation test was used for feature selection and feature transformation algorithms, including TFIDF, correlation based feature weighting with sentiment analysis, PCA  and classification algorithms, including Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Perceptrons, SVM, Random forests etc. were employed and the optimal combination was chosen. The final algorithm employed was a combination of Logistic Regression with Naïve Bayes and was able to achieve significantly low RMSE in the out of sample test data and was significantly faster than most of the other algorithms employed.</p>							<p>Our team came 14th out of the 47 teams in class and we also had the second fastest algorithm in the top 15.</p>							 <div align="center"><a href = "http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis520/fall13/finalfinalleaderboard.html"  class = "btn btn-default ">The final leaderboard</a>							 <a href = "resources\Docs\proj\ML_Project_Report.pdf" class = "btn btn-primary ">More on our algorithm</a>							 </div>		                </div>		            </div>		        </div>		</div>				<div class = "col-lg-9">		            <div class = "panel panel-default">		                <div class = "panel-body">		                    <a name="meam"></a>		                    <div class = "page-header">		                        <h3>Intoduction to Robotics Assignments and Projects <small>Posted on January, 20th, 2014</small></h3>		                    </div>		                    <a href=""><img class = "featuredImg" src = "resources\Images\project\meam.jpg" width = "100%"></a>		                    <p>This was an introductory-level course presents the fundamental kinematic, dynamic, and computational principles underlying most modern robotic systems.
